Yesterday I came across this short post by Google developer Boris Smus, who realised that his email address actually captured more contact information than was readily apparent.

</a>

I though that the idea was really neat so I hacked up a little example web interpretation of the concept. [Give it a try][2].

It's still a bit rough around the edges, but if you're interested in the code it's available in my [github repository][3].
