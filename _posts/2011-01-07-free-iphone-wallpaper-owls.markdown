These two wallpapers were one of the first things I drew when I was experimenting with my [new Wacom tablet][1] and Inkscape. They're not brilliant, but I thought I'd offer them up for anyone who was interested. 

<img alt="day-owl" src="{{site.url}}/img/posts/day-owl.jpg" width="320" height="480" style="padding:10px;" />
<img alt="night-owl" src="{{ site.url }}/img/posts/night-owl.jpg" width="320" height="480" style="padding:10px;"/>

The wallpapers are available in both iPhone (320x480) and iPhone 4 (640x960) resolutions and can be downloaded as a bundle of higher quality PNGs [here][2].
