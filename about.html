    By day I earn my keep as a Web and Software Developer and UI/UX Designer. I've consulted in various areas including software development lifecycle practice, build automation and release management. I have crafted pretty things from a variety of materials including Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ruby.

    By night I study a Graduate Diploma in Graphic Design at RMIT and freelance illustration, design and web work.

    In my spare time (har har) I hang out with my family and watch an inordinate amount of Sesame St with my daughter. I also love cooking, juggling, reading, writing, drawing, painting, comics, movies, games, card magic, sci-fi, volunteering and about a hundred other things. I look forward to spending more time doing them as soon as I figure out how to warp space-time to make my days long enough.
