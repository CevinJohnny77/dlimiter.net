    In my day job I earn my keep as a Web & Software Developer & have crafted from a variety of materials including Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Oracle Fusion, Ruby, Rails, and Perl. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In my spare time (har har) I spend time with my family, juggle (poorly) & learn as much as I can about design & illustration.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also love cooking, reading, writing, drawing, painting, movies, games, card magic, sci-fi, volunteering & about a hundred other things. I look forward to spending more time doing them as soon as I figure out how to warp space-time to make my days long enough.
