# About
 
This is the structure and content of my personal blog, powered by [Jekyll][1]. 

At present the generated site content is deployed manually. Eventually I hope to set it up with a hook that will manage deployment for me when I push a commit.

## Plugins
* [less_converter.rb][2] - Jason Graham's LESS CSS converter
