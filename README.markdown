# About
 
This is the structure and content of my personal blog, powered by [jekyll][]. 

At present the generated site content is deployed manually. Eventually I hope to set it up with a hook that will manage deployment for me when I push a commit.

The site is currently under construction and not in a production ready state. This is also my first attempt at HTML 5 structuring, so it may well be complete bunk. _Caveat Emptor_.
